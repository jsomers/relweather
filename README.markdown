It's hard to say exactly what "55 degrees" feels like. But everyone knows how hot or cold they felt yesterday. So rather than giving today's temperature in absolute units, **relweather** tells you how today is going to feel *relative to yesterday*.

## TODOs

0. Move JS into its own file.

1. Cache user searches so that we don't have to hit Google's API so often.

2. Put Google API hits in a job queue.

3. Autocomplete search.

4. Nice-to-haves:
	* Compare wind chill, etc.
	* Compare to forecasts from the same day (not just yesterday).
